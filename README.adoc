= Flask/Vue Simple Demo
:date: 28 December 2018

== Introduction
This is a simple demo of using http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask] with https://vuejs.org/[Vue] as well as https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap]. This demo provides a two page web app: the first page lets the user enter their name and the second page lets the user enter a list of favorite movies. The movies associated with each user are saved in memory by the Flask application.

I am by no means a front-end expert so do not refer to this demo for best-practices. This is simply a learning exercise for myself.

== Requirements
This demo was written with the Windows OS in mind although it should be easy enough to run on other operating systems. All dependencies should be listed in the main `_Check_Dependencies.bat` which is generated from `install\dependencies.popyaml`. Additionally, a Python requirements file is available at `install\requirements.txt`.
